# Iris Classification
Iris classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into one of three species based on their petal and sepal characteristics. The three iris species used in this problem are Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into these three species based on their measurements.
## Steps:
### 1.	Data Collection:
A comprehensive dataset of iris flower measurements, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, was obtained from a reliable source.
### 2.	Data Preprocessing:
The dataset was carefully examined and found to be well-structured with no missing values or duplicates. Data consistency checks ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.
### 3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, were created, revealing distinct clusters for each iris species. These insights indicated that the features could be used effectively for classification.
### 4.	Data Splitting:
A random split allocated 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, maintaining a representative distribution of iris species in both sets.
### 5.	Model Selection:
After trying several classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression consistently produced the best results.
### 6.	Model Evaluation:
Evaluation results on the testing dataset were impressive, with the model achieving an accuracy of over 97% in classifying iris flowers into the correct species.
